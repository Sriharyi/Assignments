-- This schema defines the following tables:

-- * `courses`: This table stores information about courses, such as course number, title, credits, syllabus, and prerequisites.
-- * `course_offerings`: This table stores information about course offerings, such as course number, year, semester, section number, timings, and classroom.
-- * `students`: This table stores information about students, such as student ID, name, and program.
-- * `instructors`: This table stores information about instructors, such as identification number, name, department, and title.
-- * `instructor_teaches_courses`: This table stores the relationship between instructors and courses that they teach.
-- * `student_enrolls_in_courses`: This table stores the relationship between students and courses that they are enrolled in.
-- * `grades`: This table stores the grades that students have received in each course that they are enrolled.

-- The relationships between the tables are defined using foreign key constraints. For example, the `course_offerings` table has a foreign key constraint that references the `courses` table. This ensures that every course offering is associated with a valid course.

-- This schema can be used to store all of the data necessary to manage the course enrollment process and track student progress.
